# infecta/Controller-LaserCut-CAD

Laser Cut CAD files and artwork(If i'm not lazy) for controllers of games from the Bemani Series

This repo will (probably) be maintained by me
(I suck at consistency -Infecta 2021)

# DISCLAIMER

I have not (yet) tested if the parts will fit well in real life, I had only tested it in fusion 360 and it fits well. (This Disclaimer Still Stands Today. Why? I lack time and money)

Part of the IIDX turntable structure was referred to [lizardbeans' CAD](https://github.com/lizardbeans/diy-iidx) (thanks~)
